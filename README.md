<h2 align=center>An online platform for university students to connect with each other.</h2> 

<h3 align=left>Description</h3> 

<h4 align=center>College students face difficulties in finding like-minded seniors or alumni from whom they can connect and take guidance. This platform helps students to connect and their seniors from their university</h4>


<p align=left>
  
- This is an online platform in which students would be able to connect and chat with the seniors or alumni or their batchmates from their university. 

- It sorts out the students based on their graduation year and then show a list of all the students present in a specific year. 

- Students will be able to create their profiles and add their socials to their profiles.  Through this, other students would be able to connect on other social platforms too.

- There are platforms available like LinkedIn but these platforms don’t provide us with the sorted list of students from a specific year. By creating this website, we are going to help the students and especially freshers, as they find it very difficult to find good seniors or good alumni to connect with.
